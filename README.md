# Heart Disease Prediction with Decision Tree

This project performs data analysis and builds a Decision Tree model to predict heart disease using a dataset of health indicators. It showcases data preprocessing techniques, model training, and evaluation. This project was developed during the **Girls Who Code Self-Paced Program 2024**. As a participant in this program, I aim to leverage my skills in data analysis and machine learning to work in the health innovation sector. My goal is to contribute to software solutions that can help improve healthcare outcomes and enhance people's lives through technology.

## Overview

This program demonstrates the following steps:
1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Encoding categorical variables
3. Building and training a Decision Tree model
4. Evaluating model performance
5. Providing practical examples of Decision Trees

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Includes label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical data.
- **Decision Tree Model**: Trains and evaluates a Decision Tree Classifier.
- **Model Evaluation**: Prints accuracy scores, confusion matrix, and insights from the model.
